# Security Incident Reporting
## The Incident Reporting Process
### 1. Initial Detection & Acknowledgement
Detection vectors can vary, ranging from human observation to automated alerts generated by deployed security tools. In some cases, the threat actor themselves may trigger the detection, especially if you're dealing with a ransomware incident.

### 2. Preliminary Analysis
During this phase, the scope and potential ramifications of the security incident must be ascertained. The incident should be categorized based on our previously established classification and severity metrics.

### 3. Incident Logging
Popular platforms for this purpose include JIRA and ServiceNow. In the absence of such a system, alternative methods should be employed. Even rudimentary tools like pen and paper or a spreadsheet can suffice in a pinch.

### 4. Notification of Relevant Parties
- Internal Communications: Relevant internal departments, such as IT, legal, PR, and executive teams, should be alerted. In cases where the incident has widespread and severe implications, an organization-wide notification may be warranted.
- External Communications: Depending on the incident's nature and impact, external communications may be necessary. This could involve notifying customers, partners, regulatory bodies, or even the general public.

### 5. Detailed Investigation & Reporting
The duration of this phase can vary significantly, ranging from a couple of days to potentially years. What's crucial here is a comprehensive technical analysis coupled with a compilation of all findings. This in-depth investigation is vital for understanding the incident's full impact.

### 6. Final Report Creation
This document will furnish regulators, insurers, and executive leadership with a detailed account of the incident, its origins, and the remedial actions taken.

### 7. Feedback Loop!
This involves revisiting and analyzing the incident to identify areas for improvement.
