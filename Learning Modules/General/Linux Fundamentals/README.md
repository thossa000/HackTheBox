# Linux Fundamentals


## Introduction
### Linux Structures
Linux follows 5 principles:

|Principle|Description|
|:-:|:-:|
|1. Everything is a file |All configuration files for the various services running on the Linux operating system are stored in one or more text files.|
|2. Small, single-purpose programs |Linux offers many different tools that we will work with, which can be combined to work together.|
|3. Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks |The integration and combination of different tools enable us to carry out many large and complex tasks, such as processing or filtering specific data results.|
|4. Avoid captive user interfaces |Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell (or terminal), which gives the user greater control over the operating system.|
|5. Configuration data stored in a text file |An example of such a file is the /etc/passwd file, which stores all users registered on the system.|
