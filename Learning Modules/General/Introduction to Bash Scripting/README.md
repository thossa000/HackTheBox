# Introduction to Bash Scripting
Brief notes written to review the material in the HackTheBox Academy module, Intro to Bash Scripting.

## Bourne Again Shell
Bash is the scripting language we use to communicate with Unix-based OS and give commands to the system. Since May 2019, Windows provides a Windows Subsystem for Linux that allows us to use Bash in a Windows environment.The main difference between scripting and programming is that we don't need to compile the code to execute the scripting language, as opposed to programming languages. In general, a script does not create a process, but it is executed by the interpreter that executes the script, in this case, the Bash.

Like programming a scripting language can be divided into the following categories:

- Input & Output
- Arguments, Variables & Arrays
- Conditional execution
- Arithmetic
- Loops
- Comparison operators
- Functions
