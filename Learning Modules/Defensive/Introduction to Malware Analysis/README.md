# Introduction to Malware Analysis
Brief notes on the HackTheBox Academy module, Introduction to Malware Analysis, in the SOC Analyst learning path.

Malware, short for malicious software, is a term encompassing various types of software designed to infiltrate, exploit, or damage computer systems, networks, and data.

The specific objectives of malware can vary among different threat actors. These objectives commonly fall into several categories:

- Disrupting host system operations
- Stealing critical information, including personal and financial data
- Gaining unauthorized access to systems
- Conducting espionage activities
- Sending spam messages
- Utilizing the victim's system for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- Implementing ransomware to lock up victim's files on their host and demanding ransom

### Malware Types

- Viruses: These notorious forms of malware are designed to infiltrate and multiply within host files, transitioning from one system to another. They latch onto credible programs, springing into action when the infected files are triggered. Their destructive powers can range from corrupting or altering data to disrupting system functions, and even spreading through networks, inflicting widespread havoc.
- Worms: Worms are autonomous malware capable of multiplying across networks without needing human intervention. They exploit network weaknesses to infiltrate systems without permission. Once inside, they can either deliver damaging payloads or keep multiplying to other vulnerable devices. Worms can initiate swift and escalating infections, resulting in enormous disruption and even potential denial of service attacks.
- Trojans: Also known as Trojan Horses, these are disguised as genuine software to trick users into running them. Upon entering a system, they craft backdoors, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized control remotely. Trojans can be weaponized to pilfer sensitive data, such as passwords or financial information, and orchestrate other harmful activities on the compromised system.
- Ransomware: This malicious type of malware encrypts files on the target's system, making them unreachable. Attackers then demand a ransom in return for the decryption key, effectively holding the victim's data to ransom. The impacts of ransomware attacks can debilitate organizations and individuals alike, leading to severe financial and reputational harm.
- Spyware: This type of malware stealthily gathers sensitive data and user activities without their consent. It can track online browsing habits, record keystrokes, and capture login credentials, posing a severe risk to privacy and security. The pilfered data is often sent to remote servers for harmful purposes.
- Adware: Though not as destructive, adware can still be an annoyance and a security threat. It shows uninvited and invasive advertisements on infected systems, often resulting in a poor user experience. Adware may also track user behavior and collect data for targeted advertising.
- Botnets: These are networks of compromised devices, often referred to as bots or zombies, controlled by a central command-and-control (C2) server. Botnets can be exploited for a variety of harmful activities, including launching DDoS attacks, spreading spam, or disseminating other malware.
- Rootkits: These are stealthy forms of malware designed to gain unauthorized access and control over the fundamental components (the "root") of an operating system. They alter system functions to conceal their presence, making them extremely challenging to spot and eliminate. Attackers can utilize rootkits to maintain prolonged access and dodge security protocols.
- Backdoors/RATs (Remote Access Trojans): Backdoors and RATs are crafted to offer unauthorized access and control over compromised systems from remote locations. Attackers can leverage them to retain prolonged control, extract data, or instigate additional attacks.
- Droppers: These are a kind of malware used to transport and install extra malicious payloads onto infected systems. They serve as a conduit for other malware, ensuring the covert installation and execution of more sophisticated threats.
- Information Stealers: These are tailored to target and extract sensitive data, like login credentials, personal information, or intellectual property, for harmful purposes. This includes identity theft or selling the data on the dark web.

### Malware Analysis Definition, Purpose, & Common Activities

Malware analysis serves several pivotal purposes, such as:

- Detection and Classification: Through analyzing malware, we can identify and categorize different types of threats based on their unique characteristics, signatures, or patterns. This enables us to develop detection rules and empowers security professionals to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the malware they encounter.
- Reverse Engineering: Malware analysis often involves the intricate process of reverse engineering the malware's code to discern its underlying operations and employed techniques. This can unveil concealed functionalities, encryption methods, details about the command-and-control infrastructure, and techniques used for obfuscation and evasion.
- Behavioral Analysis: By meticulously studying the behavior of malware during execution, we gain insights into its actions, such as modifications to the file system, network communications, changes to the system registry, and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities. This analysis provides invaluable information about the impact of the malware on infected systems and assists in devising potential countermeasures.
- Threat Intelligence: Through malware analysis, threat researchers can amass critical intelligence about attackers, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and the malware's origins. This valuable intelligence can be shared with the wider security community to enhance detection, prevention, and response capabilities.

The techniques employed in malware analysis encompass a wide array of methods and tools, including:

- Static Analysis: This approach involves scrutinizing the malware's code without executing it, examining the file structure, identifying strings, searching for known signatures, and studying metadata to gain preliminary insights into the malware's characteristics.
- Dynamic Analysis: Dynamic analysis entails executing the malware within a controlled environment, such as a sandbox or virtual machine, to observe its behavior and capture its runtime activities. This includes monitoring network traffic, system calls, file system modifications, and other interactions.
- Code Analysis: Code analysis (includes reverse engineering) and involves disassembling or decompiling the malware's code to understand its logic, functions, algorithms, and employed techniques. This helps in identifying concealed functionalities, exploitation methods, encryption methods, details about the command-and-control infrastructure, and techniques used for obfuscation and evasion. Ιnferentially, code analysis can also help in uncovering potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
- Memory Analysis: Analyzing the malware's interactions with system memory helps in identifying injected code, hooks, or other runtime manipulations. This can be instrumental in detecting rootkits, analyzing anti-analysis techniques, or identifying malicious payloads.
- Malware Unpacking: This technique refers to the process of extracting and isolating the hidden malicious code within a piece of malware that uses packing techniques to evade detection. Packers are used by malware authors to compress, encrypt, or obfuscate their malicious code, making it harder for antivirus software and other security tools to identify the threat. Unpacking involves reverse-engineering these packing techniques to reveal the original, unobfuscated code for further analysis. This can allow researchers to understand the malware's functionality, behavior, and potential impact.
